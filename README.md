# SimpleTDTutorial
  - An upload of a basic project I made with Muddy Wolf on his YT channel
  - Huge thanks to the assets provider: www.kenney.nl
  - The game isn't meant to be completed, rather somewhere I can go back to check scripts and files if I need to
  - UnityPlayer.dll compacted into .zip to fit
